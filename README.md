# Duly Notes
[Live-Site](https://www.dulynotes.com)

The goal of this project was to create something production worthy, while fortifying my understanding of React and full stack web development. Duly Notes includes features and customizations such as an inline toolbar, markdown, light/dark theme, a sidebar that toggles, and a built in pomodoro. 

## Purpose

The purpose of Duly Notes is to create an intuitive environment for users to take notes without getting distracted. Features were built around those who wish to be more productive, and to keep track of notes that needed to be studied or reviewed.
